# Data-Analysis-Portfolio
In here I will have multiple projects to show my data analysis proficiency and what I have learned in each project I've attempted. 
1. Bike Sales Analysis - in this project I took some bike sales data and analyzed purchases of bikes based on distance from work, income level, age, gender, region and so forth using pivot tables. I then made a dashboard to conduct the findings with splicers for end users to be able to find insights using more variables.
